eXpanda version 0.0.5

eXpanda is a Platform for analyzing and visualizing networks.
This software requires the latest version of perl and expat (XML::Parser)  version 1.95.0 or greater to run. Other required modules are written in DEPENDENCIES, so please check and install these modules. Installation guide is written below.

NOTE: Users of Mac OS X please take care; Please see [ Installation note for Mac OS 10.5 ]

INSTALLATION [ UNIX or BSD based OS ]

First step is to install expat. If you already have expat in your system, skip and go on to the next step.

[Expat Install]

Before you install 'eXpanda', please install expat. You can download expat
from:


	http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/


Decompress archive and move to expat directory. After you downloaded  expat from sourceforge, run the configration script to build Expat from a source by typing:


	./configure

After you have succeeded in configuring, you can build and install expat by running "make" and "make install" command. Note that you need to have a write permission into the directories where the codes will be installed. example are shown below:


	make

	make install   #or "sudo make install"


After you finished  your expat installation, go on to the next step.


[eXpanda install]


To configure this module, move to the directory that contains this README file, and type the following:


	perl Makefile.PL


Alternatively, if you are not a root user or plan to install eXpanda somewhere other than your system's perl library directory. You can type like this:


	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/you/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl


While configuring , you may see the following warnings:



	- Acme::Bleach             ...missing.
	==> Auto-install the 1 mandatory module(s) from CPAN? [y] 

This warning of dependency will be solved by installing these modules manually or automatically. If you press [y], installer will try to install the modules automatically through your CPAN module in the next 'make' step. If you press [n], you have to manually install the module from CPAN(http://cpan.org/).


After you installed the dependency modules (if you selected) and eXpanda, type the following command: 


	sudo make

If you are a super user, just type:

	
	make


You can also install only the dependant modules. Type the following command.
	

	sudo make installdeps       # install dependencies only

When you type and start the make process, eXpanda will run the CPAN module and try to download and install the dependencies. Dependency module installation process does not complete always. If the make stops by some dependant error, you can check the installed/not installed dependencies by "checkdeps" option of make. Type the following command:


	make checkdeps


After you finished all dependencies installation, you should test this module before 'make install' by typing:

	make test

If you have a write access to the installation directories, you may then install by typing:

	sudo make install


If you could not install exPanda by following the installation guide above, please report us by e-mail. Send the mail to <po@sfc.keio.ac.jp>.


[ Installation note for Mac OS 10.5 ]

First you need to download Graph::Layout::Aesthetic which is the dependent module of eXpanda.

      http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/T/TH/THOSPEL/Graph-Layout-Aesthetic-0.12.tar.gz

Deflate tarball and change directory to Graph-Layout-Aesthetic, Open Graph-Layout-Aesthetic/include/aglo.h with your favorite editor.

	% cd Graph-Layout-Aethetic

	% emacs include/aglo.h

Edit line 17 of aglo.h , rewrite 'true' to 'True', 'false' to 'False'.

   # Before
   L17: typedef enum aglo_boolean {
   L18: false=0,                      # <= This line cause Error in gcc version 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)
   L19: true=!false                   # <= This line cause Error in gcc version 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)
   L20: } aglo_boolean;

   # After
   L17: typedef enum aglo_boolean {
   L18: False=0,                      # <= 'false' to 'False'
   L19: True=!false                   # <= 'true' to 'True'
   L20: } aglo_boolean;

Build and Install Graph::Layout::Aethetic, continue installing eXpanda

    % perl Makefile.PL                   # Set PREFIX if you don't have root permission.
    % make             
    % sudo make install                  # 'make install' if you don't have root permission.
